üõ†Ô∏è **Very WIP**

This project is still under development and isn't ready for use yet. Expect substantial updates.

GTA5-AIPeds-Enhancer is an exciting open-source endeavor that aims to produce smart autonomous agents for pedestrians in GTA V using advanced language algorithms like GPT-4, built on .NET. Ideas for this project came from projects like [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), and the [ReAct framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). The intention is to create pedestrians in the game that can reason, act, and interact convincingly and in engaging ways.

The primary goal of the project is to improve the gaming experience in GTA V with AI-driven pedestrians that exhibit more intricate decision-making and behavioural patterns than the game's original NPCs. Integration with GTA V will be implemented through a FiveM server via gRPC.

Work has started to switch over to [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview).
